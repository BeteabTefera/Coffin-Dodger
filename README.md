# Coffin-Dodger
A game where the players goal is to dodge the coffins that are dropping in different rate and sizes. Its based on pygame python module and structured using the dict data structure.

# Note
The player loses when the coffin pixels get in close proxmity with the players image. That means there are occasions where the coffin doesn't hit the player and passes right through the player. I am still trying to figure how to fix that bug. Once done I will put out a new release.
